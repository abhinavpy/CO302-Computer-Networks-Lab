# Week 0 - Socket Programming

* Create a TCP/IP client-server program in which a single client connects to the server.
The server should then send a greeting to the client. Repeat the experiment using UDP.
* Create a TCP/IP client-server program. The client should send a message to the server 
asking for the current date. The server should respond with the current date that will be
displayed on the client.
* Create a TCP/IP server-client program in which both client and server can send and receive messages (Chat application).
Repeat the experiment using UDP.
* Create a chat server room such that multiple clients can connect to the server. The clients must be able to 
both send and receive messages to each other via the server. Create chat rooms using TCP and UDP.
